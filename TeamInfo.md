## Project Summary

We plan on creating a map visualization tool using a dataset of crime incidents in LA. With this web application, users will be able to apply certain filters in order to gain better insight into the crimes, the rates, and the general safety in LA and their particular neighborhood. The user would also be able to observe the progression or regression of crime within all these areas over some time period (2020 to present). The visualization would not only generate some sort of heat map to visualize the severity of crime over all the various neighborhoods and areas of LA, but the user would be able to select some time period to analyze the data over and the visualization would adjust itself accordingly. This will allow people to make informed decisions concerning trips, relocation, and general research concerning the Los Angeles area and its general safety.
